Developed an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company. The project includes full data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training using XGBoost, and model evaluation. I have deployed the model as a FastAPI service and built a user-friendly Streamlit web app that allows users to input customer details and instantly receive churn predictions.
The entire workflow was containerized and deployed through GitHub → Streamlit Cloud, ensuring automated dependency management and reproducible results.
